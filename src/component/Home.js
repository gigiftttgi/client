          All college students in various colleges have access to
          extracurricular activities. Some college club activities were also
          held by the IIMT Group of colleges. They’re usually held on campus,
          although they’re optional and don’t conflict with your regular
          classes. Social clubs, sports teams, student government, volunteering,
          and even an internship are examples of extracurricular activities.

          Participating in plays in your college campus can help you meet new
          people and develop new skills (like sewing costumes or building sets).
          Dance teams, orchestras, choruses, and other performing arts societies
          are also available.

          College club activities can give a résumé more individuality and
          improve the overall quality of a student’s job application. An
          interview request may be more likely from an employer. If a student
          was extensively involved in their college debate team, for example, it
          may demonstrate their leadership potential. This shows you took
          initiative and went “above and beyond.” It also suggests you have some
          communication experience, which could be useful in this position.
